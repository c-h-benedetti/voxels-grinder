# VoxelsGrinder: Advanced Image Processing Software for Biological and Microscopy Imaging

![tests-badge](https://github.com/c-h-benedetti/voxels-grinder/actions/workflows/cpp-build.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

VoxelsGrinder emerges as a modern and efficient solution in the realm of biological and microscopy image processing. With the increasing complexity and maintenance challenges of legacy software like ImageJ and its Fiji distribution, there is a growing need for a tool that is not only easier to maintain but also capable of leveraging current hardware architectures to handle the ever-growing volume of microscopy data efficiently.

## Key Features

- **High-Performance C++ Implementation**: VoxelsGrinder is built in C++, ensuring high performance and efficient use of resources, crucial for handling large-scale microscopy data.
- **Integrated Image Viewer**: The software includes a sophisticated image viewer, offering comprehensive visualization capabilities.
- **Basic Image Processing Functionalities**: Provides essential tools for image processing, tailored specifically for biological and microscopy imaging needs.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - **Python Scripting Support**: Planned integration of Python will offer scripting capabilities, making it versatile for various user needs.
  - **Node-Based Automation System**: An upcoming feature to introduce a node-based programming system, designed to simplify processes for users without prior programming experience.
- **Focus on 3D Imaging**: Unlike many Fiji functions that are limited to 2D or pseudo-3D (slice-by-slice processing), VoxelsGrinder is dedicated to genuine 3D implementations, ensuring comprehensive analysis and visualization in three dimensions.

## Project Goals

The primary objective for the initial version of VoxelsGrinder is to deliver a complete and robust image viewer comparable to that of Napari, with added enhancements and efficiencies. This foundational component will set the stage for more advanced features and capabilities in subsequent releases.

## Contributions and Feedback

VoxelsGrinder is an ongoing project, and contributions from the community are welcome. Whether you're a developer, a scientist, or an enthusiast in the field of microscopy and image analysis, your input and feedback can help shape the future of this tool.
